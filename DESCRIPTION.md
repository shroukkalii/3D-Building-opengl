# ComputerGraphics 12th Project using opengl


3D building with sky and grass from different prespectives, movements, textures, and lightning.

also, you can move around it to see all sides with ambient light.

to move around it use the arrow keys (right,left,up,down)

transformations are applied using: 
                          
                       "home" key in your keyboard to translate the building on the positive x-axis to the right.
                                   
                       "page up" key in your keyboard to rotate the building with 15 degree around the positive z axis.
                                   
                       "page down" key in your keyboard to rotate the building with 15 degree around the negative z axis.
                                   
                       "end" key in your keyboard to return to initial position.


textures are used to make the scene almost real;

download the textures on your laptop and send their paths to "loadTexture" function to load the bitmap images.

images are loaded using a cpp code and header file "imageloader.cpp""imageloader.h" and then included in the opengl code.

to apply different textures visit this link https://opengameart.org/node/27572 and choose what you like then convert it to bitmap file here https://online-converting.com/image/convert2bmp/
